# INSTRUCTION #
1.  The circuit is pretty much self explanatory from the schematic
2.  The main components of the device are : High Voltage Transformer , Battery , Coil
3.  The capacitor is made by creating a gap between the conducting wires held inside the white cylindrical casing
4.  The coil is made by wrapping an enamel coated copper wire (commonly known as magnet wire) on the inner side of a pvc tape
5.  The jumper in the middle is for added safety feature as to not activate the device on accident
6.  The charging is module is for the rechargable battery, you may skip that part
